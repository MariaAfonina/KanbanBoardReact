      A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help
      visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
      It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily
      work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help
      technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get
      it done! Kanban has come a long way from its origins in lean manufacturing
      thanks to a small but mighty group of kanban enthusiasts.
      <br />
      David Anderson’s work defining the kanban method helped bring kanban into
      the software and services space, and Personal Kanban, by Jim Benson and
      Tonianne DeMaria, helped expand the applications of kanban to places you
      wouldn’t believe. David Anderson established that kanban boards can be
      broken down into five components: Visual signals, columns,
      work-in-progress limits, a commitment point, and a delivery point.
      <br />
      Kanban can be adapted to many environments, from manufacturing to human
      resources, to agile and DevOps software development. The type of
      environment adapting kanban often dictates if the board is physical or
      digital. In my research, I discovered a $58 million dollar construction
      job managed with a physical board in a trailer and I spoke to many, many
      software teams using digital kanban boards.
